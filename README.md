# Hi!

Node: v25.1.0

You can then run a local server using:

`hugo server` or `npm run start`

or you can build your site using:

`npm run build`

## Theme

This website uses [Dot-Org](https://github.com/cncf/dot-org-hugo-theme) as the baseline theme.

They have a [demo site available that also includes examples of how to use it](https://dot-org-hugo-theme-demo.netlify.app/).

The theme is installed as a git submodule. To update it, run:

`git submodule update --remote --merge`
