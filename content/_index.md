{{< intro >}}
Complex products demand more than good design—they need teams aligned around clear goals, confident in their decisions, and moving efficiently together. I build the UX operations and cross-functional collaboration that make that possible.

I started out as an art kid in a very small town in Massachusetts - [more about that here](https://www.example.com). I translated my love of art and technology into a web development career, then UX design—where I built my first team from the ground up at CollegeNET. These days I’m delivering appointment scheduling tools for the [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs](https://www.example.com), from my home base in Portland Oregon. Here are some highlights from my work.
