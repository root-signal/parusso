I translated a love of creativity and technology into an art degree, then a career as a web developer before finally landing on my career as a user experience designer, where my first role was to build a successful team.

Before all of that I grew up in rural Massachusetts where I learned how to be bored in innovative ways, usually involving exploring the woods or hanging out with my D&D buddies.

Currently I live in Portland, Oregon where I practice art and illustrate children’s books among (too) many other hobbies, and steep in the natural beauty and creative nerdiness that fills my adopted town.
