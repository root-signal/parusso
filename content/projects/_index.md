## Additional work

I’ve been a contractor/lead at Ad Hoc under the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) since 2020, so all of my case studies cover that time period.

In past lives I’ve also designed tools that:

- Automate processing of insurance claims for doctors to easily review
- Help engineers Identify and manage product risk
- Let students apply to many colleges at once

If projects in those areas interest you more than appointment scheduling, I’m happy to discuss those.
